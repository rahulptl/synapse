### main idea

As a user I want a chrome extension that I can install and it should do the following. 
Allow me to got any website and from the website I can say add this to my context ( via mouse, drag drop, or select a particaly content )
the exntesion should have file structure, the user can create new folders nested folders and then add it to the relavent folder. 
basically as I am working, I want to build context ( LLM friendly ) for each of my topics it can be antyhing from 'persona;' to a sales rep building context for a potential customer. 
I should be able to download the context of it, once added I should a button that says summarize which takes our data and sends it to an LLM and creates LLM friend prompt context.
