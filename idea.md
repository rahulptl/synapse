I want to build a chrome extension that does the following.



it a context manager for users using llms.

users will enter domains that they want to manage context for. whenever the user goes on that web page and itneracts with the LLM such as chat gpt or gemini or others, it records their conversation and when they leave it, it sends it to to a llm to summarize it and returns a summarized of what the chat did, like changes, uses, any implementation sugggestions or anything, and stores it locally, so that the next time the user visits any of the other LLMs this extension can inject this prompt/context to it and the new llm already knows the users history and directly start working on the prompt/





how does this idea sound?

what is its feasbility?

is it technically feasible? what are the issues you see in it?

from a cost perspective?
